    'historytext1' => 'The Institute of Automobile Mechatronics was established on July 1, 2013 as a pedagogical and scientific research unit of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of STU in Bratislava. The establishment of the Institute of Automobile Mechatronics was a logical result of the intention of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of STU in Bratislava to establish an institute that would take into account the current requirements and needs of the automobile industry in Slovakia with the main goal of preparing graduates of bachelor and engineering study in the field of automobile mechatronics.',
    'historytext2' => 'At present, the Institute of Automobile Mechatronics provides research, development and education in several areas of applied mechatronics with special emphasis in automobile mechatronics and mechatronic systems based on the integration and synergy of mechanical, electronic, information, communication and control technologies into complex mechatronic automobile systems.',
    'historytext3' => 'The Institute guarantees study programs at all levels of study accredited at STU in Bratislava. For the wide-area teaching and research field it ensures the integration of researchers and educators from the FEI STU into the research and teaching process in the individual study programs.',
